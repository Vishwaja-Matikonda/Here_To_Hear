                    <p>Mental health is the level of psychological well-being or an absence of mental illness. It is the
                      state of someone who is "functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional and behavioral
                      adjustment". </p>

                    <p>From the perspectives of positive psychology, mental health may include an individual's ability
                      to enjoy life and to create a balance between life activities and efforts to achieve psychological
                      resilience. </p>

                    <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health includes "subjective well-being,
                      perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, inter-generational dependence, and
                      self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others".</p>
                    <p> The WHO further states that the well-being of an individual is encompassed in the realization of
                      their abilities, coping with normal stresses of life, productive work, and contribution to their
                      community. </p>

                    <p>Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how
                      one defines "mental health".</p>

                    <p>Certain stressors can trigger an illness in a person who is susceptible to mental illness. These

                    <li>Social or cultural expectations (For example, a society that associates beauty with thinness can

                    <p>Some mental illnesses have been linked to abnormal functioning of nerve cell circuits or pathways
                      that connect particular brain regions. Nerve cells within these brain circuits communicate through
                      chemicals called neurotransmitters. </p>

                    <p>"Tweaking" these chemicals -- through medicines, psychotherapy or other medical procedures -- can
                      help brain circuits run more efficiently. In addition, defects in or injury to certain areas of
                      the brain have also been linked to some mental conditions.</p>


                    <h5> <B>Genetics(Heredity):</B> </h5>
                    <p> Mental illnesses sometimes run in families, suggesting that people who have a family member
                      with a mental illness may be somewhat more likely to develop one themselves. Susceptibility is
                      passed on in families through genes. </p>
                    <P>Experts believe many mental illnesses are linked to abnormalities in many genes rather than
                      just one or a few and that how these genes interact with the environment is unique for every
                      person (even identical twins). </P>
                    <p>That is why a person inherits a susceptibility to a mental illness and doesn't necessarily
                      develop the illness. Mental illness itself occurs from the interaction of multiple genes and
                      other factors -- such as stress, abuse, or a traumatic event -- which can influence, or trigger,
                      an illness in a person who has an inherited susceptibility to it.</p>


                    <h5><b> Infections: </b></h5>
                    <p> Certain infections have been linked to brain damage and the development of mental illness or the
                      worsening of its symptoms. </p>



                    <h5><b> Brain Defects & Injury: </b></h5>
                    <p> Defects in or injury to certain areas of the brain have also been linked to some mental
                      illnesses.</p>


                    <h5><b> Prenatal Damage: </b></h5>
                    <p> Some evidence suggests that a disruption of early fetal brain development or trauma that occurs
                      at the time of birth </p>
                    <p> For example, loss of oxygen to the brain -- may be a factor in the development of certain
                      conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder.</p>

                    <h5><b> Substance Abuse: </b></h5>
                    <p> Long-term substance abuse, in particular, has been linked to anxiety, depression, and paranoia.
                    </p>


                    <h5><b> Other Factors: </b></h5>
                    <p> Poor nutrition and exposure to toxins, such as lead, may play a role in the development of
                      mental illnesses.

                    <p> In the short-term, mental health problems can cause people to be alienated from their peers
                      because
                      of perceived unattractive personality traits or behaviors. They can also cause anger, fear,
                      sadness
                      and feelings of helplessness if the person does not know or understand what is happening.</p>
                    <p> In the
                      long-term, mental health disorders can drive a person to commit suicide. According to the National
                      Institute for Mental Health, over 90 percent of suicides have depression or another mental
                      disorder
                      as factors.</p>

                  <p>Your doctor might have talked to you about ‘recovery’. Some doctors and health professionals think
                    of recovery as no longer having mental health symptoms. Sometimes this is called ‘clinical

                    is important to someone else.</p>

                  <P> Hope underpins the recovery process of mental illness, as recovery depends on the notion that a

                    keeps us strong when we encounter challenges. And hope gives us a sense of joy and peace, knowing
                    that a better tomorrow exists.

                    Your recovery journey may be easier if you learn to accept your illness and the difficulties it
                    causes. You may have to accept that there are some things that you can’t do anymore. But focus on
                    what you can do. You are more likely to reach your goal if it is realistic.

                  <P>
                    You could write down when you feel mentally unwell or stressed. You should include things like:

                                  Activities such as gardening or tackling a home improvement project can be great
                                  ways to start moving more when you have a mood disorder—as well as helping you
                                  become more active, they can also leave you with a sense of purpose and
                                  accomplishment.

                                  Whatever time of day you decide to exercise, wear clothing that’s comfortable and
                                  choose a setting that you find calming or energizing. That may be a quiet corner
                                  of your home, a scenic path, or your favorite city park.

                                  Part of the reward of completing an activity is how much better you’ll feel
                                  afterwards, but it always helps your motivation to promise yourself an extra treat
                                  for exercising. Reward yourself with a hot bubble bath after a workout, a
                                  delicious smoothie, or with an extra episode of your favorite TV show.

                                  Exercising with a friend or loved one, or even your kids, will not only make
                                  exercising more fun and enjoyable, it can also help motivate you to stick to a
                                  workout routine. You’ll also feel better than if you were exercising alone. In
                                  fact, when you’re suffering from a mood disorder such as depression, the
                                  companionship can be just as important as the exercise.

                                  Good mental health is not simply the absence of diagnosable mental health problems,
                                  although good mental health is likely to help protect against development of many such
                                  problems.

                                such as becoming an adult, retiring, starting a family, or losing someone we love.
